# CryptoClustering

Background

I will use my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The best value for k is 4.

When using the PCA data the best value fo k is 4.

Basic on my finding, cryptocurrencies can be cluster into 4 distinct groups as proven with the dataset provided.
